description: The Nomad Developer Portal has added a couple new templates for quickly creating code-focused Hyperdrives.
title: "Two new templates: Codesnip and Module"
---

[Templates](/docs/templates/) are a fast way to create new Hyperdrives in Nomad. They typically provide a nice UI which you can then fill with your content.

Today we're happy to add two new templates: [Codesnip](/docs/templates/codesnip) and [Module](/docs/templates/module).

## The Codesnip Template

{{< /imgcard >}}

"Codesnips" are a common tool among Web developers to share example code, often to demonstrate APIs, patterns, or techniques. [Codepen](https://codepen.io/) and [JsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) are two well-known services for these kinds of snippets. We're happy to say, with Codesnips you now have a `hyper://` solution.

## The Module Template

"Modules" are like Git repos. They provide a number of tools that are ideal for sharing code, including a files-listing UI, a tests suite, a demo-viewer, and build tooling. This template uses [page commands](https://docs.beakerbrowser.com/advanced/webterm#page-commands) to make it possible to run custom scripts using the terminal.
